## üìö Accounting Basics Explained

### What is Double-entry Bookkeeping?

Every transaction affects at least two accounts:

- **Debit**: Left side (increases assets/expenses, decreases liabilities/income)
- **Credit**: Right side (decreases assets/expenses, increases liabilities/income)

### Account Types

- **Assets**: What you own (Bank, Cash, Property)
- **Liabilities**: What you owe (Loans, Bills)
- **Income**: Money you earn
- **Expenses**: Money you spend
- **Equity**: Your ownership stake

### Simple Rules

1. **For every debit, there must be a credit**
2. **Total debits must equal total credits**
3. **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **App won't start**: Make sure you have Windows 10 or later
- **Data not saving**: Ensure the app has permission to write to your Documents folder
- **Slow performance**: Close other applications to free up memory
